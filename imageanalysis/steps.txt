1. Get a list of colors from the image and how often they occur (get_pil_clist -> (count, color) == color_histogram (?))
	# color_histogram returns hash of Magick::Pixel to count
	e.g. {red=61253, green=59280, blue=55599, opacity=0 => COUNT, }
	http://studio.imagemagick.org/RMagick/doc/image1.html#color_histogram
2. Quantize by representative set of colors
3. Convert to HSLA

4. Compare lightness to see if white, between grey/black, black
5. Compare saturation to see if grey

6. If not 4 or 5, 
	store in dict as:
		key =  num quantized colors * hue (maybe quantized already?)
		already have hue in degrees

		loop through hue degrees dict
			# THIS IS FOR THE PIE CHART
			if a color in 0 to 359
				keep a list of how far the hue is from the reference colors and the reference color
					e.g. (hue degrees - reference degree, reference)
			then find the reference degree that is closest to the hue degree
				and increment the count of that reference degree by 1
